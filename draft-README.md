# Tn-Seq Analysis Service

## Overview

The Tn-Seq Analysis Service facilitates determination of essential and conditionally essential regions in bacterial genomes from data generated from transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-Seq) experiments. Tn-Seq (in the broad sense used here) refers to a family of related methods that use deep sequencing to survey a transposon insertion library and quantify the abundance of insertions at different sites in the genome.

*Note: The BV-BRC Tn-Seq Analysis Service wraps the [TRANSIT](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004401) software.  Please cite this reference when publishing results from this service:*

## About this module

This module is a component of the BV-BRC build system. It is designed to fit into the
`dev_container` infrastructure which manages development and production deployment of
the components of the BV-BRC. More documentation is available [here](https://github.com/BV-BRC/dev_container/tree/master/README.md).

This module provides the following application specfication(s):
* [TnSeq](app_specs/TnSeq.md)
